OpenACC Versions of NEMOLite2D
------------------------------

This directory contains versions of NEMOLite2D that use OpenACC
directives. These were provided by Jeremy Appleyard of NVIDIA.

In order to build a particular version you must ensure that
Makefile.include contains the correct settings for your compiler and
then copy/link your chosen version to nemolite2d.f90 before running
make.

The various versions are:

nemolite2d.vanilla.f90        - basic OpenACC version
nemolite2d.indep_clause.f90   - loop independent clause added to
                                boundary-condition kernels
nemolite2d.collapse_loops.f90 - i,j loops COLLAPSE'd where appropriate
nemolite2d.mom_short_loop.f90 - SHORT LOOP clause added to loops in momentum
                                kernel
nemolite2d.fused_mom.f90      - loops computing the u- and v-components fused
nemolite2d.cuda_mom.f90       - as above but with the Momentum kernel supplied
                                as a CUDA (Fortran) kernel
