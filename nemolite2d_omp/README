OpenMP Versions of NEMOLite2D
-----------------------------

This directory contains sub-directories for each of the following OpenMP
versions of NEMOLite2D:

nemolite2d_omp_basic         - OMP PARALLEL DO for each loop nest
nemolite2d_omp_single_region - Single OMP PARALLEL region
nemolite2d_omp_1st_touch     - 1st-touch policy applied to arrays
nemolite2d_omp_nowait        - Reduce synchronisation using NOWAIT
nemolite2d_omp_early_single  - Move single region earlier to allow cost to be
                               amortized

As with the serial versions of NEMOLite2D, the optimisations in the above
list are cumulative.

Since the first two of these versions do not include the 1st-touch policy,
these include an earlier version of the GOcean Infrastructure Library that
did not have this feature.
