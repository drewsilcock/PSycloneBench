# OpenCL version of NEMOLite2D #

This directory contains the C implementation of the OpenCL version
of NEMOLite2D. It was originally developed to use the AMD dispatch
library with an NVIDIA GPU as the compute device. It has subsequently
been adapted to use the Intel OpenCL toolset to target an FPGA as
the compute device.

## Compiling ##

TBC. Can the same code work on both GPU and FPGA?

## Running ##

TBC.
